# Teleprompter for Frame

Simple teleprompter that loads a text file picked from the user's device and sends text with a typewriter effect to the frame with line scolling.

Next/Previous paging through content is done via a vertical swipe up or down anywhere on the application screen.

As a result, bluetooth page-turning (and "tiktok scrolling") rings can be used for paging forward and backward, since they (some of them, at least) connect as a HID device imitating a mouse, and perform a click and drag up/down over a certain region of the display.
